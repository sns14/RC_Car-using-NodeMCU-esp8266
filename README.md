# RC Car using NodeMCU-esp8266

The project is designed for remote controlled car using Nodemcu. 


## Introduction

The evolution of wireless communication plays a vital role in the industry campaign. Wireless systems are employed in different dimensions like security, manpower, machine learning, database management systems and so on. Here, wireless controlled RC car is a result of networking patriarchy. Wifi technology is an abundant technology for communication, data transfer as well as data management. 

Usually, regular RC car have separate remote which limits its working for that particular car. If the remote is broken or damaged the entire system is of no use. The purpose of the project is to develop a car which is controlled by the mobile app (NodeMCU_Car) and remote connected to car by wifi. We do not require any separate remote to access the car and it can be controlled by any smartphone and its user friendly to. Initially, we have used “Arduino IDE” to “Program” the board/microcontroller. The Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is an open source electronics platform (for Windows, macOS, Linux). 
A set of code is written in this Arduino IDE software and this code is uploaded to Nodemcu esp8266 using type A to micro USB cable from PC. The ESP8266 is set of high performance, high integration wireless SOCs, designed for space and power constrained mobile platform designers.  It provides unsurpassed ability to embed wifi capabilities within other systems, or to function as a standalone application, with the lowest cost, and minimal space requirement. 

Now we use Motor drivers which runs the motors. H-bridge is present inside motor driver which is an electronic circuit that switches the polarity of a voltage applied to a load. The main application is to allow DC motors to run forwards or backwards.
